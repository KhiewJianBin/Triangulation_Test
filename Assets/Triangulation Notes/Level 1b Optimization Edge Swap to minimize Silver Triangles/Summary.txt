Ear-clipping Based Algorithms of Generating
High-quality Polygon Triangulation

Kong, Everett and Toussaint algorithm [9], which adopts the Graham scan to select
ears.This algorithm is sensitive to the shape of the polygon and runs in
O(n(r+1)) time

Sloan [6] also developed an
O(n2) ear-clipping algorithm

Explanation Basic Alogirhtm based on Oâ€™Rourke, J. (1998). to give less silver triangles
Explanation Improve Alogrithm to include "edge swaping"

Explanation to create "bridges" to deal with polygon with holes
