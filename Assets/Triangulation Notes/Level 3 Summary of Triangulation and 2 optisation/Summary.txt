Summary of Triangulation Modified Ear Clipping via choosing to clip triangles based on aspect ratio and using Visabilty graph post
 triangulation to optimize triangles 2011
 
 Triangulation by standard ear-slicing
 Toussaintâ€™s strip triangulation
 Triangulating a monotone polygon
 
 Improved Triangulation
 1. search for best diagonal to slice an ear
 2. Triangulate normally, then compute visibility gragh, 
 3. look though the graph for intersection with the triangles of triangulation
 4. the diagonal that has highest intersection of triangles (Stabbing number)
 5. sort diagonals by highest stabbing number,
 6. make sub polygon using highest stabbing number
 7. tiangulate sub polygon
